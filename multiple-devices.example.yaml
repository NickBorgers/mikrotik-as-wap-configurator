# MikroTik Multi-Device Configuration Example
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Create this file with just device credentials
#   2. Run: ./backup-multiple-devices.js multiple-devices.yaml
#   3. Edit the generated configs (replace UNKNOWN passphrases if any)
#   4. Run: ./apply-multiple-devices.js multiple-devices.yaml
#
# For multiple physically close devices:
#   - Use non-overlapping channels (2.4GHz: 1/6/11, 5GHz: 36/52/149)
#   - Enable fast roaming for seamless handoff
#   - Use ./diag/optimize-wifi-channels.js to analyze and suggest optimal channels
