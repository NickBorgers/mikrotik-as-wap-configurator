# Unused interfaces to disable for security
# If you use ether2, remove it from this list and add to managementInterfaces
disabledInterfaces:
  - ether2

# SSID Configuration
# Each SSID can be broadcast on 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or both bands
ssids:

  - ssid: MyNetwork
    passphrase: secure-password-here
    vlan: 100
    bands:
      - 2.4GHz
      - 5GHz

  # SSID on 5GHz only (for faster devices)
  - ssid: MyNetwork-5G
    passphrase: secure-password-here
    vlan: 100
    bands:
      - 5GHz

  # Guest network on both bands with different VLAN
  - ssid: Guest-WiFi
    passphrase: guest-password
    vlan: 200
    bands:
      - 2.4GHz
      - 5GHz
