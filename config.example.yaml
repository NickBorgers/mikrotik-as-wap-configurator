# Management interfaces
# Typically ether1 is used as trunk port (untagged management + tagged VLANs)
managementInterfaces:
  - ether1

# Unused interfaces to disable for security
# If you use ether2, remove it from this list and add to managementInterfaces
disabledInterfaces:
  - ether2

# WiFi Optimization Settings (Optional)
# Configure channel, power, and roaming settings for optimal performance
# Especially useful when multiple APs are deployed in close proximity
wifi:
  country: United States    # Regulatory domain (applies to all bands)

  # 2.4GHz band settings
  2.4GHz:
    channel: 1              # Channel number (1-13, use 1/6/11 for non-overlapping)
    # frequency: 2412       # Or specify frequency in MHz directly
    txPower: 15             # TX power in dBm (adjust based on coverage needs)
    width: 20mhz            # Channel width (20mhz recommended for 2.4GHz to avoid interference)

  # 5GHz band settings
  5GHz:
    channel: 36             # Channel number (36/52/149 recommended for non-overlapping)
    # frequency: 5180       # Or specify frequency in MHz directly
    txPower: 18             # TX power in dBm
    width: 20/40/80mhz      # Channel width (20/40/80mhz for better throughput, or 20/40/80/160mhz if supported)

  # Fast Roaming Settings (802.11k/v/r)
  # Enables seamless handoff between multiple APs
  roaming:
    enabled: yes            # Enable fast roaming features
    neighborReport: yes     # 802.11k - Radio Resource Management
    bssTransition: yes      # 802.11v - BSS Transition Management
    fastTransition: yes     # 802.11r - Fast BSS Transition

# SSID Configuration
# Each SSID can be broadcast on 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or both bands
ssids:
  # SSID on both bands (typical use case)
  - ssid: MyNetwork
    passphrase: secure-password-here
    vlan: 100
    bands:
      - 2.4GHz
      - 5GHz

  # SSID on 5GHz only (for faster devices)
  - ssid: MyNetwork-5G
    passphrase: secure-password-here
    vlan: 100
    bands:
      - 5GHz

  # Guest network on both bands with different VLAN
  - ssid: Guest-WiFi
    passphrase: guest-password
    vlan: 200
    bands:
      - 2.4GHz
      - 5GHz

# Supported bands: 2.4GHz, 5GHz
# Supported VLANs: Any VLAN ID (100, 200, etc.)
