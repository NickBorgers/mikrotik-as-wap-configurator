# Management interfaces
# Typically ether1 is used as trunk port (untagged management + tagged VLANs)
managementInterfaces:
  - ether1

# Unused interfaces to disable for security
# If you use ether2, remove it from this list and add to managementInterfaces
disabledInterfaces:
  - ether2

# WiFi Optimization Settings (Optional)
# Configure channel, power, and roaming settings for optimal performance
# Especially useful when multiple APs are deployed in close proximity
wifi:
  country: United States    # Regulatory domain (applies to all bands)

  # 2.4GHz band settings
  2.4GHz:
    channel: 1              # Channel number (1-13, use 1/6/11 for non-overlapping)
    # frequency: 2412       # Or specify frequency in MHz directly
    txPower: 15             # TX power in dBm (adjust based on coverage needs)
    width: 20mhz            # Channel width (20mhz recommended for 2.4GHz to avoid interference)

  # 5GHz band settings
  5GHz:
    channel: 36             # Channel number (36/52/149 recommended for non-overlapping)
    # frequency: 5180       # Or specify frequency in MHz directly
    txPower: 18             # TX power in dBm
    width: 20/40/80mhz      # Channel width (20/40/80mhz for better throughput, or 20/40/80/160mhz if supported)

# SSID Configuration
# Each SSID can be broadcast on 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or both bands
#
# Fast Roaming (802.11r/k/v) - configured per-SSID:
#   fastTransition: true   - 802.11r Fast BSS Transition (reduces handoff time)
#
# Recommendation:
#   - Enable for mobile devices (laptops, phones) that move between APs
#   - Disable for stationary devices (Sonos, IoT) that may have 802.11r issues
#
ssids:
  # Primary network with full roaming support for mobile devices
  - ssid: MyNetwork
    passphrase: secure-password-here
    vlan: 100
    bands:
      - 2.4GHz
      - 5GHz
    roaming:
      fastTransition: true  # 802.11r enabled - seamless handoff between APs

  # 5GHz only network with roaming (high-performance devices)
  - ssid: MyNetwork-5G
    passphrase: secure-password-here
    vlan: 100
    bands:
      - 5GHz
    roaming:
      fastTransition: true  # 802.11r enabled

  # IoT/Sonos network - 802.11r DISABLED for stationary devices
  # Many IoT devices and Sonos speakers have issues with 802.11r
  - ssid: IoT-Devices
    passphrase: iot-password
    vlan: 100
    bands:
      - 2.4GHz
    # No roaming config = 802.11r disabled (recommended for stationary devices)

  # Guest network - 802.11r disabled for simplicity
  # Guest devices may have varying 802.11r support
  - ssid: Guest-WiFi
    passphrase: guest-password
    vlan: 200
    bands:
      - 2.4GHz
      - 5GHz
    # No roaming config = 802.11r disabled

# Supported bands: 2.4GHz, 5GHz
# Supported VLANs: Any VLAN ID (100, 200, etc.)
